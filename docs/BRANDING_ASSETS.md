# Branding Assets (tapog.ai)

Updated: February 25, 2026

## Source logos (user provided)
- Primary: `branding/source/logo-primary.png` (from `img/tapog2.png`)
- Alternate: `branding/source/logo-alt.png` (from `img/tapog.png`)

## Current extension icons
- `assets/icons/icon16.png`
- `assets/icons/icon32.png`
- `assets/icons/icon48.png`
- `assets/icons/icon128.png`

## Saved exports for reuse
- `branding/exports/logo-16.png`
- `branding/exports/logo-32.png`
- `branding/exports/logo-48.png`
- `branding/exports/logo-128.png`

## Future macOS app icon note
When you move to a macOS app build, reuse `branding/source/logo-primary.png` as the source image.
Recommended pipeline:
1) Generate iconset sizes (`16,32,64,128,256,512,1024`)
2) Build `.icns` with `iconutil`
